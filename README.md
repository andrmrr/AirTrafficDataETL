# Air Traffic
The goal of the project is to create a **fully-functioning ETL pipeline** using **Talend** for air traffic data. Additionally, the project includes an interactive dashboard in **Tableau** as well as query execution plan optimization using bitmaps. Data included multiple databases and lookup tables. This project was an assignment for the Data Warehousing course, the assignment had strict structure and businees rules that had to be followed. Aside from modelling and defining the
extract, transform and loading steps of the pipeline, additional queries **PostgreSQL queries** were written to enhance the ETL process. The same queries later had to be optimized, for which bitmap indexes were used.
